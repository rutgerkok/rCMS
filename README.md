## rCMS

Simple CMS for my website. Requires CKEditor and CKFinder. Unsupported at the moment. :frowning:

## Installation
You'll need PHP (5.3+) and MySQL. [Download](https://github.com/rutgerkok/rCMS/archive/master.zip) and extract it to a place where it is visible for the world. Open the config.php file and edit at least the database and path settings. Now go to the website and click the link to install the database tables. Follow the instructions. After you are done, you should add some widgets to the home page, so it is less empty.
