## rCMS

Simple CMS for my website. Requires CKEditor and CKFinder.

## PHP 5.2
This branch exists for servers running PHP 5.2. Bugfixes from the main code branch are backported to this branch.

## Installation
You'll need PHP (5.2+) and MySQL. [Download](https://github.com/rutgerkok/rCMS/archive/php52.zip) and extract it to a place where it is visible for the world. Open the config.php file and edit at least the database and path settings. Now go to the website and click the link to install the database tables.
