## Installation
You'll need PHP (5.3+), MySQL and Composer. 

1. [Download][] or clone this repo. Place the files somewhere that is accessible from your browser.
2. Make sure [Composer][] is installed. Run `composer install` in the root directory of this project.
3. Copy the file `config.sample.php`, save it as `config.php`. Edit the settings in the `config.php` file.
4. Open the website in your browser. If something went wrong during steps 2 and 3, the site will tell you. Otherwise, you will see a button to create the necessary database tables. Click this button.
